> during the early visual processing stages, observers can extract many types of basic-level information (such as spatial configuration) and use them to identify the basic content of the scene (such as its category)

> 提出场景主题(gist of a scene)一词: The term “gist” has been widely used to refer to scene content ranging from low-level features (e.g., color or luminance) to high-level information (e.g., events occurring in the scene

> observers could extract some global scene properties without recognizing individual objects and use this information to guide their attention and eye movements.

问题在于场景的主题信息是何时被获取到的？**when and where the gist of a scene is learned**

scene gist can be extracted from low spatial frequency informa- tion alone (Schyns and Oliva, 1994; Oliva and Torralba, 2006)

> in most cases the term “gist” indicates the information extracted in early visual processing (20–100 ms) that can convey the meaning of a scene and is sufficient to categorize the scene. Whether object recognition is necessary before perceiving scene gist, or whether visual attention is needed for gist recognition are still open questions.
